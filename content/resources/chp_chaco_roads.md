description: Around Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, NASA's Thermal Infrared Multispectral
  Scanner (TIMS) detected over 200 miles of a prehistoric roadway system (shown in
  red, fanning out from lower right). Compare these prehistoric roads with the current
  day roads, in yellow, which follow the topography and path of least resistance in
  construction. Why were the Chacoan roads designed with exacting linearity, surmounting
  any topographic obstruction, built to a width of 20 feet or more, and constructed
  by people who did not even employ beast of burden in their lives? (Image courtesy
